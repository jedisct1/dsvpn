# Memory-Safe DSVPN Patches

I've created memory-safe versions of the DSVPN patches that address potential buffer overflow issues and memory leaks:

## 1. safe-nocrypto-patch.diff

This is an enhanced version of the nocrypto patch with the following safety improvements:

- **Proper packet size validation**: Checks actual received data size before accessing extended fields
- **Buffer initialization**: Ensures all memory is initialized before use
- **Removed unused variables**: Eliminated the unused `ptr` variable
- **Added length validation**: Validates packet lengths to prevent buffer overflows
- **Improved error handling**: More informative error messages and safer error paths

## 2. safe-noroutes-patch.diff 

This is an enhanced version of the noroutes patch with these safety improvements:

- **NULL pointer checking**: Added validation for argument pointers
- **Clear initialization**: Better context initialization
- **Argument validation**: More thorough checking of command-line arguments

## 3. safe-combined-patch.diff

This combines all the safety enhancements from both patches, providing a comprehensive solution that:

- **Prevents buffer overflows**: Properly validates all buffer accesses
- **Avoids memory leaks**: Ensures proper cleanup in all paths
- **Handles edge cases**: Safely manages unexpected input conditions
- **Offers better error reporting**: More detailed and useful error messages

## Usage

You should use these safer patches instead of the original ones:

```bash
# Apply the safe-combined-patch (recommended)
patch -p0 < safe-combined-patch.diff

# Or apply individual patches if needed
patch -p0 < safe-nocrypto-patch.diff
patch -p0 < safe-noroutes-patch.diff
```

These patches maintain all the functionality of the original patches while addressing potential security issues related to memory handling.
